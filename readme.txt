Formataway lets you exclude selected post formats from your post index page's
main query.

== Description ==

I was creating link posts on http://www.bilalakil.me's Twenty Fourteen happily
until I was nonplussed by the doppelgÃ¤ngers revealed when I added the theme's
also-impressive Euphoria widget to the mix - to display links.

To solve this problem I decided to exclude posts with the link post format from
the post index page's main query, and thus this plugin was born.

My plugins don't beg for donations or for you to read my name. Instead it has
its settings sitting neatly on the Settings > Reading page (that's right! not
in a page of it's own), editable by anybody who has permission to get there.

You can find this plugin at https://github.com/bilalakil/Formataway!

1. All you'll see in the backend from this plugin. Other than the funky name,
   you wouldn't even be able to tell it apart from the WordPress core.

== Changelog ==

* WordPress v4.1.1 tested and supported!

= 1.1.0 =
* WordPress v4.0 tested and supported!
* We now append our taxonomy constraint to the list of all other constraints

  know how to get around it until a friendly person enlightened me:
  http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/155946/#155949).
