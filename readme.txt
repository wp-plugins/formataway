Formataway lets you exclude selected post formats from your post index page's main query.

== Description ==

I was creating link posts on WordPress' impressive Twentyfourteen happily
until I felt distraught by the dopplegangers revealed when I added the theme's
also-impressive Euphoria widget to the mix - to display links.

To solve this problem I decided to exclude posts with the link post format from
the post index page's main query, and thus this plugin was born.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.1 =
* Fixed a typo...

= 1.0.0 =
* First release, allowing you to specificy what to formataway from the Settings > Reading admin screen.
